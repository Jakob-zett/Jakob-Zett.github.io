Short letter to the Editor at the Economist in response to:  ["Assessing the Pain"](https://www.economist.com/china/2018/05/24/a-threatened-trade-war-between-china-and-america-may-be-on-hold) (May 26th) <br>
<br>

<h2> Reassessing the pain </h2> <br>
In the battle about technological supremacy “Assessing the pain” (May 26th) for America may become similarly important. The robotics example still holds up perfectly to illustrate why. <br>
Boston Dynamics, in 2016, changed ownership from American conglomerate Alphabet to Japanese conglomerate Softbank, also owner of the european chip designer ARM. <br>
Simultaneously, the American trade war is no longer an exclusive to China, but is now also targeted at its allies, like Japan and Europe, pushing them towards closer bilateral cooperation without the US.<br>
The point was made that China cannot survive in case of isolation in today's world. But neither can America. <br>
And even though it may not be semiconductors they will be missing, maybe it will be high-tech robotics.
