Endless space: The blessing and the curse brought by the digital and brought by the internet. <br>
<br>
One letter, one byte.
Endless numbers of bytes.
Endless space to compile and accumulate endless stuff you like and you may want to think about. <br>
But later. <br>
Because right now there is some other thing to do.<br>
<br>
Why is this?<br>
Your endless to-do list!<br>
<br>
Endless plans, concepts, ideas. Piles of them. <br>
<br>
Piles of alternative possibilities, of options, of choices to make. Becoming harder the more they get. <br>
In an endless stream where new things can be put on top, always.<br>
<br>
*We became hoarders of our future.*<br>
<br>
That's when the paradox kicks in:<br>
<br>
You would think more space for your lifes plans, equals doing more. <br>
But now: It's only the things on your to do list that seem to get more and more. <br>
You still have only 24 hours a day. <br>
But now: this time seems to be more messy.<br>
<br>
Divided between writing this, coding that, a day job in between, getting to this weekly event to meet that person -- and finally getting back to this thing that you started writing in the morning, while all these other things you could do keep lurking in the background. <br>
<br>
And you will end up having done nothing. <br>
<br>
You never were at this event really, because your head was always somewhere else.<br>
You never were writing something meaningfull, because your head was never really there.<br>
<br>
*Attendance is worth nothing without attention.* <br>
<br>
You only really do things, if they get your unlimited attention.<br>
<br>
Not limited by ten other possibilities.<br>
Not limited by you being miserable because you miss out on all these other ideas you already roughly sketched down yesterday.<br>
<br>
Not limited by your endless to-do list.<br>
<br>
*Unlimited space means limited attention.<br>
Limited space means unlimited attention.* <br>
<br>
Consider switching to limited space.<br>
Maybe switch to analoge. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And dare you adding this to your endless to-do list.<br>
