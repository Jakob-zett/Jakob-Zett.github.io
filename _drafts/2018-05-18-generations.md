It started with Gen X and with Millennials it became a widespread phenomenon. For the first time a larger proportion of people in a generation perceives their daily job as something that should be fulfilling, as opposed to something that brings in the money.
The line between jobs and hobbies seems to blur entirely. 

This notion about Generation Y is nothing particularly new and it can be explained with a fairly simple and well known concept. 

Maslow’s hierarchy of arranges the basic needs of a human being:

What it basically states is that human beings prioritize needs in a specific order.
Only if one need is met sufficiently we move on to the next one above. Thus our efforts and our motivation are directly linked to the fulfillment of the current insufficiently satisfied need. 
Needs determine efforts. And efforts in turn determine the personality. 

In other words, before you can concentrate on becoming a great musician, loved by the whole world and recognized by experts, you’ll probably make sure not to starve.

This one visualizes this a lot better for my taste:


Think of it as the entire possible spectrum of human personality.
(Which is kind of a sad thought)
Enough food enables the sufficient satisfaction of physiological needs, while our families give us a feeling of belonging and so on. 

Throughout history society progressed, which at its core means we built mechanisms and structures that feed us, protect us, and to a certain extent allow us to love and belong, get approval from society or approve of ourselves.
These mechanism reach from the developments in farming and infrastructure, which allow us not to care whether there will be running water the next morning, to the system of democracy as the most stable system of government, to facebook feeding people with societies approval before they even shower or have breakfast.
In other words we built mechanisms, which work to sufficiently satisfy our needs and allow us to move on to the next one in the pyramid.
In that way the development of society proceeds in a manner that it mirrors the potential human personal development and allows us to shift our efforts further up.

The extent to which one has access to these mechanisms therefore determine towards which goal, which need, his or her efforts have to be directed. 

The result is one simple snippet, one window within the spectrum above and each is made up of a specific amount of every of the 5 human needs.
That means, the order of needs within the pyramid now doesn’t necessarily have to correspond with the traditional pyramid by Maslow. It is more or less individual, dependent on the access to the above mechanisms.

More or less, because every society has a majority that lives in a certain social class.
Think of a social class as nothing but a group with similar access to these mechanisms, consequently the snippet will look fairly similar within it. 

And as society changes or progresses human personality changes, because human efforts will always be focused on one step above in the hierarchy, than is currently allowed by the mechanisms that serve our needs. 






Past:


Visualized this means that in some past generation the personality of a majority was made up similar to this snippet. 
Physiological needs cover up most of the space and made up most of our efforts. If guaranteed the next most important need, safety, came into play. Afterwards love and belonging. 
It took a very long time and there were setbacks like wars destroying progress, but until we arrived where we are today we created first cities then global organizations, we utilized farming and now genetically modify seeds for even bigger crops, we built local tribes and now we have a worldwide social network so we can show off to even more people. 

The point is that we built a lot of structures, which can be as good as they can be bad, but we shaped them in a way that they exactly serve our needs and which now in turn shape our needs of today.











The Present: 



Todays window now incorporates a wider variety of needs. Our focus is widespread. 

We strive for belonging and esteem becomes a very important part of our personality. 

But there is one particular development, which is new in all of human development, and it brings us back to the beginning of this text. There is one big shift:
Physiological needs, being of a perpetually high importance to us, for the first time in history decrease in importance, while at almost the exact same speed self-actualization becomes a priority. 
Eventually, they intersect and the indicator for this intersection is Generation Y.

For some people in this generations a certain amount of wealth or money, as the predominant provider for physiological needs and security in modern society, has always been given.
Likewise, social structures have never been that tight and sturdy in the history of humankind. Helicopter-parents guard every step of their children. They ensure everything is safe in advance, they are over supportive and convey their children that the are unique and special. We now think it’s strange, but it is most likely our future.
Growing up within these structures safety, love and esteem and above all physiological needs have always been sufficiently satisfied and the personality of this generation, like it did thousand of years ago, adapted. In that way the efforts towards self-actualization overtook these directed towards physiological needs.

And that is where many people see a problem with Generation Y. They have been raised in a society marked by abundance. However, this abundance is still heavily connected to repetitive, boring and unfulfilling human labour. The mechanisms and structures we built are not yet capable of providing for our physiological needs unconditionally. It still needs most of our efforts.

But, whatever we think about this generation, there is one important bottom line.
This generation shows not only that society develops in a way that optimizes for the nourishment of human beings with needs in the same order of maslow's pyramid. It always did.
But it reveals that we are on a verge right now (and with right now I mean the hundreds of years surrounding our present time). And we belong to the first generations that live on this verge, that has a personality which manifests this verge. A verge that means a radical shift in priorities for our society. A verge enabled by abundance of the material things, which was worked for thousands of years, allowed by thousand of little pieces that function together to sustain who we are as people today. A verge that manifests in our human values. A verge were the immaterial overtakes the material.



The future: 



And since entitlement is considered one major negative characteristic of Millennials here is why the generations to come may be even more interesting:
If we can cross this border from the material to the immaterial entirely in a few hundred years through further automation and maybe through a Universal Basic Income or some other mechanisms and structures we will dream up, then unconditional self-actualization at some point will be the predominant effort of a whole generation. 
We are at the top of Maslow's pyramid. And, like we always did, we will built structures and mechanisms that facilitate our self-actualization for us. 

And all at once we will reach a point which is radically different. Different beyond the human spectrum we always knew. 

We will hit a point where there is nothing above in the pyramid of our own needs. There is nothing in ourselves to reach for next. For a larger and larger amount of people more of anything would only be surplus of the same but wouldn’t add something new to the equation that is our personal development.
It sounds so counterintuitive to us because for thousands of years, literally for all of human existence, our goal was to ensure the sufficient satisfaction of our own, personal needs and we came together as societies to achieve that. But the inherent goal, still, has always been our personal gain.

And what happens next? We don’t really know!
Centuries, thousands of years always looking only at what is above our heads, what we can achieve next, what is the next step on our way to the top of the pyramid. And now?
Maybe we will finally take a deep breath and take a look back, a look at what is already below us. Appreciate all that we already have built, what we achieved. But also what we destroyed on our way there, what we forgot, who we left behind blindly. And maybe we will find what we were looking for, what we were striving for, all the way, all the time on our journey to the top. And maybe that will change something. Something in ourselves. 
Maybe there will be a new irrational drive that we, once again, do not really grasp, do not really control. 
But, this time, it will bring us somewhere else. 
Maybe, we will realize, it first had to bring us to ourselves, before it could bring us together.
